# React Instantsearch Search as You Type Experience

This repo contains a PoC for a search as you type experience in Next.js using [React Instantsearch Hooks](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch) with SSR. The built experience allows the user to type on any page and transition smoothly into the search page without pressing any button.
